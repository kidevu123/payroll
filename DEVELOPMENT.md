## 🔄 Going Forward - Clean Workflow

### For Code Changes:

1. **Make changes locally** or in your development environment
2. **Test the changes** to ensure they work
3. **Commit to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push origin main
   ```

### For PythonAnywhere Deployment:

1. **Pull latest from GitHub:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/kidevu/payroll
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. **Reload the web app** on PythonAnywhere

### For UI Changes:

- The enhanced UI is in `simple_app.py`
- All modern styling is already implemented
